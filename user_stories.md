- They can add an address to the list of approved dealers, so if the owner of that address logs into the app, they have access to the dealer functions.
- They can add/remove items to the catalogue. These products do not have a quantity: as a manufacturer, it can produce them in infinite quantities.
- These products have a reference price and an incentive bonus, that the manufacturer can both change.
